== Description ==

The DYNO Mapper Sitemap Generator streamlines the discovery and planning phase of web development. The Visual Sitemap Generator connects to your Google Analytics account and enables you to sort and filter pages by defined metrics like page-views, bounce rate, etc. The Content Inventory displays all pages, images, files, and links and also checks your website for bad-links and errors. The DYNO Mapper Login plugin for Wordpress guarantees that DYNO Mapper can authenticate and crawl both public and private pages of any website built with Wordpress.
